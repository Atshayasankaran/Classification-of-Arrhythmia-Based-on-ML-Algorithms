# Classification-of-Arrhythmia-Based-on-ML-Algorithms
An arrhythmia is a condition characterized by irregularities in the heart's rate or rhythm, where the heart may beat too quickly, too slowly, or with an abnormal pattern. To diagnose arrhythmias, the most commonly used test is the electrocardiogram (ECG). The ECG captures electrical activity of the heart and displays key points, known as fiducial points, labeled P, Q, R, S, T, and U, along with segments and intervals. Variations in these points, segments, and intervals can indicate the presence of arrhythmia. Various types of arrhythmias can be detected through ECG signals. Machine learning techniques are often employed to analyze these patterns, helping to identify the specific type of arrhythmia a patient may have.

# Dataset
The MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Dataset is used in this project. It containing both training and testing data. In total, there are 109446 instances across the dataset, which are categorized into five classes: 'N': 0, 'S': 1, 'V': 2, 'F': 3, and 'Q': 4. Class 'N' represents normal or non-ectopic beats, 'V' refers to ventricular ectopic beats (VEB), 'S' represents supraventricular ectopic beats (SVE), 'Q' indicates unknown beats, and 'F' represents fusion beats.
